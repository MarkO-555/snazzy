Three event interfaces:

1. from low-level IO from app/system to GUI
     mouse/keyboard events
2. from GUI to widgets
     
3. from GUI to userspace


If we want loadable forms, we can't transmit (load) meaningful pointers. We can resolve references (once) after load.  Internal ptrs could be in relative form


    void (*doev)(widget *w, int ev);
    //    void (*uev)(widget *w, int ev);
    widget *next;
    widget *child;
    char *text;
