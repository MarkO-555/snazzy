TODO:
   better, slight bigger font(s).
   form stack.
   too many global vars.
   padding.
   table / grid layout?
   window dressings (macros?)
   icons.
   scrollable lists.
   menu size: don't size on children, just text field.
   makefile: make objs via make macros.
   pop/menu widgets not popping back up
   cursor mangles screen on init draw
   mwidget is really just a flag - not a pointer.


****************************************

Three event interfaces:

1. from low-level IO from app/system to GUI
     mouse/keyboard events
2. from GUI to widgets
     
3. from GUI to userspace

*****************************************

If we want loadable forms, we can't transmit (load) meaningful pointers. We can resolve references (once) after load.  Internal ptrs could be in relative form


    void (*doev)(widget *w, int ev);
    //    void (*uev)(widget *w, int ev);
    widget *next;
    widget *child;
    char *text;

9/13/19 - done. widget are all relative pointers now.
